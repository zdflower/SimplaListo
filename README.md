# SimplaListo

This is a simple todo list made with javascript as an excercise.

I've learned (or reviewed) how to set event listeners and to act on the targets, how to change the style of a node (and how to make text crossed), how to add nodes, how to create elements, how to set attributes, all using javascript.

I've watched videos and read from:
- Beau Carnes teaches javascript DOM on Youtube,
- Eloquent Javascript and
- DOM Enlightment.
